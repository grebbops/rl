# Installation

## Requirements

- `jq`: [Read more](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/)
- `python` and [`python-dateutil`](https://pypi.org/project/python-dateutil/)
- a `bash` flavored shell: Windows users can use [Git Bash](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-bash)
  - also consider [enabling `sudo` for Windows](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/introducing-sudo-for-windows/)

## Installation Steps

- clone the repo
- `cd release-tools/rl/bin`
- `sudo ln -fs $( cd "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )" && pwd )/rl /usr/local/bin/rl`
  - note: for Windows users, the `cp` command should be used, with variation in the path: 
  - `cp -s $( cd "$( dirname "$0" )" && pwd -W )/rl /c/Users/<username>/bin/rl`
- reload shell
- test `rl` with no args:

```shell
❯ rl

   /\
  (  )
  (  )
 /|/\|\
/_||||_\

```

Your mileage may vary — check paths and system nuances. Windows and macOS have variations of standard *nix commands, and the Windows filesystem and paths are tricky.

You could also just add this to path via `~/.bashrc`, `~/.bash_profile`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.

- add this line `export PATH="/c/Users/<username>/path/to/repo/rl/bin:$PATH"`
- or this line `export PATH="/path/to/repo/rl/bin:$PATH"`
